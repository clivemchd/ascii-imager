# ASCII Art Converter - AI Assistant Prompts and Templates

## User Support Prompts

### How to Use the Tool
"To convert an image to ASCII art:
1. Upload an image by clicking or dragging into the upload area
2. Optionally check 'Remove Background' for transparent background processing
3. Adjust quality level (higher numbers = more detail, max 5,000,000)
4. Choose a character set (Detailed, Simple, Blocks, or Custom)
5. Customize colors if desired
6. Click 'Convert to ASCII' 
7. Download in your preferred format (PNG, SVG, or TXT)"

### Background Removal Feature
"The background removal feature uses AI technology that runs entirely in your browser. Your images never leave your device - all processing happens locally using WebAssembly (WASM). This ensures complete privacy while providing professional background removal results."

### Quality Settings Explanation
"Quality level determines the number of characters used in the ASCII output:
- Lower numbers (100-1,000): Simple, quick conversion
- Medium numbers (1,000-10,000): Balanced detail and size  
- Higher numbers (10,000-100,000): Very detailed output
- Maximum (5,000,000): Ultra-high detail (may be slow)

Leave empty for automatic calculation based on image size."

### Character Set Guide
"Character sets determine the visual style of your ASCII art:
- **Detailed (@%#*+=-:. )**: Traditional ASCII with varied density
- **Simple (‚ñà‚ñâ‚ñä‚ñã‚ñå‚ñç‚ñé‚ñè )**: Modern block characters for clean look
- **Blocks (‚ñà‚ñà‚ñì‚ñí‚ñë  )**: Solid blocks for bold, graphic style
- **Custom**: Enter your own characters from darkest to lightest"

Supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (recent versions)"

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
"**Image won't upload**: Check file format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP supported) and size
**Background removal fails**: Ensure stable internet for initial model download
**Conversion is slow**: Try reducing quality level or image size
**Download not working**: Check browser popup blockers
**Blurry result**: Increase quality level or use higher resolution source image"
